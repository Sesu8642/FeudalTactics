# Feudal Tactics - Medieval Strategy Game

A medieval strategy game with countless unique and challenging levels. You play on an randomly generated island made of hexagons. Your goal is to conquer all of it. To do so, you attack the enemy with your units while trying to protect your own kingdoms. Made with libGDX. The game mechanics are heavily inspired by Sean O'Connor's Slay.

## Licensing of Contributions
Contributions are multi-licensed under __GPL-3.0-or-later or MIT__. See [CLA](CLA.md).

This allows me to potentially release versions that contain propriatary libraries, e.g. for integrating third party multiplayer services or receiving payments. The F-Droid version will never contain any proprietary components, of course.

Why not just license contributions under MIT? All files somebody contributes to would be licensed under GPL-3.0-or-later __and__ MIT. While the MIT license is compatible with the GPL-3.0, it does add the additional requirement to include the MIT license text in the software. This would make it complicated if anyone wanted to use some file in a different project. With the multi-licensing, every file can simply be used under GPL-3.0-or-later.
