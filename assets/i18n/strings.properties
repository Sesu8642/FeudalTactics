tutorial-objective-1=Feudal Tactics is a turn based strategy game. You play on an island composed of hexagonal tiles. Each tile is colored to show which player owns it.\nTwo or more connected tiles of the same color form a kingdom.\n\nObjective: Click/tap your big kingdom in the bottom right of the island to select it.\n\nHint: The turn indicator in the top left corner of the screen shows the color of the player whose turn it is. Since it is your turn, this color matches the color of your tiles.\n\nNote: You can always see your current objective using the button that looks like this:
tutorial-objective-2=After selecting your kingdom, you can see its finances in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nExample: Savings: 14 (+12)\n14 is the amount of coins this kingdom has. They can be used to buy units or castles.\n12 is the income per turn. Each kingdom gains one coin per tile. The income is reduced by the salaries of its units.\n\nObjective: Click this button on the bottom of the screen to buy a peasant for 10 coins:
tutorial-objective-3-1=Note how your savings and your income have lowered.\nYou now have the peasant in your hand, as indicated by the hand icon on the right side of the screen.
tutorial-objective-3-2=\nYou can place it in your own kingdom or conquer an enemy tile. A peasant can only conquer tiles that are not protected, as it is the weakest unit.\n\nObjective: Conquer the unprotected tile adjacent to your kingdom.
tutorial-objective-4-1=After conquering, units like your peasant can no longer be moved until the next turn.\n\nPress this button to end your turn:
tutorial-objective-4-2=Your enemies will then do their turns.\n\nObjective: End your turn and re-select your kingdom.
tutorial-objective-5-1=The tiles of your enemy's adjacent kingdom are protected by the capital. Units, capitals and castles protect the tile they are placed on as well as all adjacent tiles. The protection level of a tile is indicated by up to four shield icons.
tutorial-objective-5-2=To conquer a protected tile, you need a unit with greater strength. In this case, you need at least a spearman to conquer a tile protected by a capital. To get stronger units, place a peasant on another unit.\n\nObjective: Buy another peasant and place it on your existing one to create a spearman.
tutorial-objective-6-1=The spearman you created takes a higher salary than a peasant. Here is an overview of all the units.
tutorial-objective-6-2=Objective: Attack your enemy with the spearman.\n
tutorial-unit-table-unit=Unit
tutorial-unit-table-strength=Strength
tutorial-unit-table-salary=Salary
tutorial-objective-7=Since you reduced the size of your enemy's kingdom to one tile, its capital was destroyed and turned into a tree.\n\nThere are two types of trees: palm trees and oak trees. Palm trees grow on coast tiles. They spread in every turn. Oak trees grow on all other tiles. They only spread when there are two oaks adjacent to each other. When there is a tree on a tile, you will not gain any income from it. Trees can be chopped by placing a unit on them. After that, the unit can no longer be moved until the next turn, even when the tree is growing in your own kingdom.\n\nObjective: Chop the tree.\n\nNote: You need to end your turn so that your spearman can move again.\n
tutorial-objective-8-1=It's now time to buy a castle. Since they don't need salary, they are ideal for long term defense. Only knights and barons can destroy castles.\n\nUse this button to buy a castle for 15 coins:
tutorial-objective-8-2=Objective: Buy and place a castle.\n\nNote: You might need to end your turn once or more to collect enough coins.\n\nHint: Place the castle near your enemies, as it only protects the adjacent tiles.\n
tutorial-objective-9=Now you know the basics.\n\nBeware of your capital being destroyed, as you will then lose all your money.\nAlso make sure your enemy doesn't split your kingdom into two, as only the part with the capital will keep your money and the other part will start from 0.\n\nIf you cannot pay your units at the start of your turn for one reason or another, they will die and leave gravestones. They, in turn, will become trees after one turn.\n\nObjective: conquer the whole island to win the game.\n
tutorial-objective-10-1=You can use this button to undo moves, but only within the current turn:
tutorial-objective-10-2=Objective: conquer the whole island to win the game.\n
tutorial-objective-11=There are several shortcuts available:\n- undo move: Android or mouse back button\n- buy peasant: right mouse button click\n- buy and place peasant in own kingdom: double tap/click\n- buy castle: middle mouse button click\n- buy and place castle: long press/click\n\nObjective: conquer the whole island to win the game.\n
